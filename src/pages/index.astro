  <h1>Greeting Traveler!</h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to my little corner of the internet. I'm a software engineer, and a
    full time disappointment. This is where I write about things I'm interested
    in, and things I'm working on. I hope you find something interesting here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some notes are private, so if you're looking for something specific, you can
    always contact me.
