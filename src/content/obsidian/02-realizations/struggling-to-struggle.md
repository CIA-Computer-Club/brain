## It's okay.

The phrase I always use to avoid doing the things that I'm supposed to do, to escape the struggle, and to seek comfort and entertainment.

> "It's okay, let's do it tomorrow."
> "It's okay, I'll only sleep for a bit."
> "It's okay, ..."

## It's not okay.

What is the point of a fleeting moment of entertainment if it only leads to feelings of guilt and disappointment later on? Why avoid the struggle like a coward just to struggle even more? Why live life like a loser?


🍀 *But it's okay, cuz I'll think about it tomorrow...*
