With these websites, you can surprise your loved one with various website designs depending on their preferences to further increase the love between you two. And if youâ€™re a computer scientist, you can check the GitHub webpage and change the design to your partner's liking. [Project Link](https://github.com/CIA-Computer-Club/valentines)

1. Why was the website created?
    - It was created to enhance the members skills in creating various websites using the same concept but with different styling. In doing so, our members would be able to produce a greater quality website at a later time. Additionally, it was to bring upon a new way of confessing or getting closer to your partner or loved
one.
2. Is there any difficulty in creating the article?
    - In order to create the web page listed above, the difficulty is not that great, but it is difficult to properly style the website and create the effect when people click the no button because it needs to randomly generate the text and generate the location of the text.
