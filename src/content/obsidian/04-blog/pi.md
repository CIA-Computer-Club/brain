# $\pi$
$\pi$ (pronounced pī) is one of the most well-known mathematical constant, represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. $\pi$ is an irrational number, equals to 3.1415926…

In celebration of Pi Day (3.14), we have written about $\pi$ by the many things that $\pi$ equals to.

### Archimedes
Around the 250 BCE, [Archimedes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes) found an ingenious way to approximate $\pi$ using polygons. He began by inscribing a regular hexagon (six-equally-sided polygon) inside a circle and then circumscribing another regular hexagon outside the same circle.

By calculating the exact circumferences and diameters of these hexagons, then divide the circumferences by the diameters, he obtained a rough approximation of $\pi$. It equals to an average of 3.14158, a five digits accuracy in today's world. 

But he didn't stop there. Archimedes continued this process with polygons of increasing sides. As he doubled the number of polygon sides, he obtained closer approximations for π.
At 1536 sides, he achieved the first six digits of π: 3.14159, a six digits accuracy in today's world.

To see how inscribing a regular polygon inside a circle help us approximate $\pi$, you check out the following: [Approximating Pi with Inscribed Polygons - Wolfram](https://demonstrations.wolfram.com/ApproximatingPiWithInscribedPolygons/) 
### Modern Formula
$$\pi = \lim_{n\to +\infty} n\sin(\frac{180\textdegree}{n})$$
[A Geometrical Derivation of π (Pi)](https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jm/papers/Vol11-issue6/Version-1/D011611922.pdf)
$n$ is the number of sides of the polygons.
For ten million sides, we obtain 3.141592653589741, a 14 digits accuracy.

# Epilogue 
To all digits of $\pi$ we ever see, whether it is in hundreds, trillions or zillions, they are still an approximation, because $\pi$ was, still is and will always be irrational.
