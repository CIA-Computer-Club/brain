1. Can you share a bit about yourself and your interest in coding and technology?
   - Hi, I'm known online as [Sliden](https://github.com/Sliden101)! I'm interested Open Source Software and enjoy semi-competitive programming.

2. How did you first get interested in coding, and what languages or areas do you enjoy working in?
   - I first studied C#, but then moved away as I switched to Linux. Now I do backend programming and machine learning with Typescript and Python respectively.

3. What has been your experience learning to code, and do you have any tips for students starting out?
   - My experience has been a lot of hands on programming aka project based. I've mostly just learned the language and read the documentation for the projects I want to do. I do use books and video resources to have a deeper level of knowledge over the code I am writing.

4. What kinds of coding challenges or problems do you enjoy tackling the most?
   - Currently I enjoy [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/sliden101/) problems the most. They offer a wide range of enganging problems to tackle while bringing your skill level up. 

5. How do you think coding allows you to express your creativity and innovate?
   - I'm really not a creative person as in not actively creating innovative or ground-breaking designs. However whenever I write hacky solutions in my codebase I can pretend to be a creative and innovative person ^.^ 

6. What are some of the biggest challenges you've encountered while learning to code, and how have you overcome them?
   - I would say the biggest challenges in learning to code is consistency. If you aren't consistent with your learning there is a lot of difficulty that you will face while attempting projects. I think when starting out I was also quite concieted as in being affected heaving by the Dunning-Kruger effect. While I may be be more competent now, I still wouldn't dare slack off.

7. What advice would you give to other students who are interested in learning to code but may feel intimidated?
   - Make sure you have a goal! Whether it's to impress a cute girl or trying to make something cool. Having a clear and straight forward goal will keep you motivated to improve and completing projects.

8. What are your goals or aspirations regarding coding and technology in the future?
   - I *plan* on taking a bachelors's in Mathematics while studying programming on the side. A wise man once said "Computer Science was only invented because Mathematicians needed to math harder".

9. Are there any books, websites, or resources that you've found particularly helpful in your coding journey?
   - [Eloquent Javascript - Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) This book was my first proper programming book.
   - [Hacking: The Art of Exploitation Second Edition ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacking:_The_Art_of_Exploitation#Content_of_2nd_edition) Lots of low level knowledge and provides surface level and deepdives into how hacking actually works.
   - [The Pragmatic Programmer - Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer) Enjoyable read, especially applicable for web devs :>
   - [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/) Very good resources, especially for understanding Data Structures and Algorithms.
   - [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org) Wikipedia for math theorems to solve leetcode problems.
   - [Primeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeTimeagen) [Theo](https://www.youtube.com/@t3dotgg) [Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) [Devsalife](https://www.youtube.com/@devaslife) [Suckerpinch](https://www.youtube.com/@tom7) Youtubers
   - [Design Patterns](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans) [Papers](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/design-patterns-for-humans) Github Repositories
 
10. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with coding or any final thoughts for our readers?
    - Idk just keep at it, I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. To fool others you must first fool yourself! hey girl, did u know? Cyber crimes I am wanted for: 0
