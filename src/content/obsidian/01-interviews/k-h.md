1. Can you share a bit about yourself and your interest in coding and technology?
    - I'm interested in Cryptography, Mathematics and Machine Learning.

2. How did you first get interested in coding, and what languages or areas do you enjoy working in?
    - Why I am interested in coding? If you know me, I like to grind on lots of stuff (games, books, movies, Khan Academy etc.) for some bragging rights. So I grind a lot of codes on SoloLearn and Mimo (Pirated). I was learning languages like Python, HTML & CSS on phone...

3. What has been your experience learning to code, and do you have any tips for students starting out?
    - Have fun! Start from a small project, learn as you work on it. 

6. What are some of the biggest challenges you've encountered while learning to code, and how have you overcome them?
    - BUGS! Lots of searching and testing codes.

7. What advice would you give to other students who are interested in learning to code but may feel intimidated?
    - Coding is just math, and math is easy!

10. Is there anything else you'd like to share about your experiences with coding or any final thoughts for our readers?
    - If you don't think that you're able to finish, don't start. If you start, don't quit.
